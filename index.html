            <p><b>A deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the micro-service migration problem with affinity in the cloud(Expert Systems With Applications | JCR Q1)</b>(Under review)<br>Third Author</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
            <p><b>Bytedance Research Project "Data Center Micro-service Scheduling (Phase II)"</b></p>
            <p><b>Participate | 2022.10 - 2023.10</b></p>
            <p>This project is funded by Bytedance Inc. and focuses on the micro-service migration problem with affinity, stemming from the cloud computing industry. 
                Because micro-services are invariably changing to satisfy users' demands, the deployment of micro-services has to be regularly adjusted, called micro-service migration.
                An optimal migration method should minimize the number of activated physical machines and migration steps as well as maximize services' total internal affinity.
                This kind of problem requires such a large dataset and complex modeling that traditional methods make it hard to calculate the most probable situation.
                We propose a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learing(MARL) algorithm and improve its efficiency by fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet model.
                We validate the proposed MARL on both synthetic datasets and real cloud traces of ByteDance, compared to two heuristic benchmark approaches: Migration Ant Colony Optimization and Migration Neighborhood Search.
                Finally, we propose an evaluation mechanism called the Matching Score to explain the superior performance of MARL. 
            </p>
            <p>In this project, I was mainly responsible for the construction of heuristic algorithms and data mining.
                I have tried Bestfit, Firstfit, annealing algorithm and other benchmark algorithms.
                At the same time, I assisted my supervisor (Second Author) and his postgraduate student (First Author) to build the basic reward structure of multi-agent.
                Through this project, I have gained more understanding of operations research and reinforcement learning.

            <p><b>Course Project "Langchain-Chatchat LLM Fine-tuning"</b></p>
            <p><b>Participate | 2024.02 - 2024.04</b></p>
            <p>This project is supervised by Associate Professor Peilin Jiang and Former Technical Director of Alibaba.
                With the advent of GPT-4o and the latest generation Gemini, promoting the localization of large language models is one of the most important applications of large language models.
                We utilized web crawlers to collect data from both official and unofficial school web pages, followed by thorough data cleaning.
                The cleaned data was then segmented using bidirectional maximum matching and annotated accordingly.
                Finally, we fine-tuned the model parameters to develop a large language model based on the school's knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p>In this project, I collaborated with other team members to design the entire knowledge base localization strategy from start to finish.
                I was also responsible for fine-tuning the model parameters and performing data cleaning.
                Upon the project's completion, after an online trial and approval from our tutor, I achieved a final grade of 95(GPA 4.3/4.3).
            </p>
            <p><b>Course Project "Research on application of satellite navigation system in the field of deep space navigation"</b></p>
            <p><b>Host | 2024.05 - 2024.08</b></p>
            <p>This project is supported by Professor Yikang Yang who works at the Manned Lunar Landing Expert Group and focuses on the probability of using satellite navigation in deep space navigation. 
                It's very difficult to navigate outside the solar system with existing navigation conditions, and the only example so far is Voyager 1.
                In the absence of a fixed reference system, this project studies asteroid avoidance and star navigation positioning, trying to provide a little inspiration for possible interstellar navigation in the future.
                We constructed a mathematical model named the spacecraft satellite ring and employed four-point positioning in space to ascertain whether the spacecraft's path coincided with the asteroid's trajectory, thereby determining whether the avoidance action should be implemented.
                Compared with traditional celestial navigation and ground-based fixed deep space navigation, we propose that positioning accuracy can be effectively enhanced through the utilization of the adjoint satellite and the validity of this theory is demonstrated by mathematical calculation.
            </p>
            <p>In this project, I primarily proposed the navigation model and established the mathematical model throughout.
                I acquired more experience in independently completing a project, and my mathematical and modeling capabilities were also manifested.
                Finally, I received full scores(GPA 4.3/4.3) from my supervisor.
