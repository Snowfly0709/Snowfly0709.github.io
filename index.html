            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p><b>A deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the micro-service migration problem with affinity in the cloud(Expert Systems With Applications | JCR Q1)</b>(Under review)<br>Third Author</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
            <p><b>Micro-Service Rescheduling in Cloud Computing Center</b></p>
            <p><b>Research Assistant, Adivisor: Prof. Ning Ma, XJTU, Collaboration with ByteDance Inc. | 2022.10 - present</b></p>
            <p>This project is funded by Bytedance Inc. and focuses on the micro-service migration problem with affinity, stemming from the cloud computing industry.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Because micro-services are invariably changing to satisfy users' demands, we formulated an optimal migration method minimizing the number of activated physical machines and migration steps as well as maximizing services' total internal affinity.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We propose a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learing(MARL) algorithm based on Advantage
                    Actor-Critic Algorithm and improve its efficiency by fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet model.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We validate the proposed MARL on both synthetic datasets and real cloud traces of ByteDance, compared to two heuristic benchmark approaches: Migration Ant Colony Optimization and Migration Neighborhood Search.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MARL framework consistently maintained stability on datasets ranging from 10 to 60 machines and 80 to 200 service types.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Finally, we propose an evaluation mechanism called the Matching Score to explain the superior performance of MARL.</p>
            <p>In this project, I was mainly responsible for the construction of heuristic algorithms and data mining.
                I have tried Bestfit, Firstfit, annealing algorithm and other benchmark algorithms.
                At the same time, I assisted my supervisor (Second Author) and his postgraduate student (First Author) to build the basic reward structure of multi-agent.
            </p>
            <p><b>Langchain-Chatchat LLM Fine-tuning</b></p>
            <p><b>Reaserch Assistant, Adivisor: Associate Prof. Peilin Jiang, XJTU, Collaboration with Alibaba Inc. | 2024.02 - 2024.09</b></p>
            <p>This project focuses on the localization of large language models, one of the most important applications of large language models.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We utilized web crawlers to collect 10k data from both official and unofficial school web pages, followed by thorough data cleaning.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The cleaned data was segmented using Bidirectional Maximum Matching(BMM) and annotated accordingly.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Finally, we fine-tuned the model parameters to develop a LLM based on the school's knowledge base.</p>  
            <p>In this project, I collaborated with other team members to design the entire knowledge base localization strategy from start to finish.
                I was also responsible for fine-tuning the model parameters and performing data cleaning.
                Upon the project's completion, after an online trial and approval from our tutor, I achieved a final grade of <b>95(GPA 4.3/4.3)</b>.
            </p>
            <p><b>Research on application of satellite navigation system in the field of deep space navigation</b></p>
            <p><b>Project Leader, Adivisor: Prof. Yikang Yang, XJTU | 2024.05 - 2024.08</b></p>
                <p>In the absence of a fixed reference system, this project studies asteroid avoidance and star navigation positioning, trying to provide a little inspiration for possible interstellar navigation in the future.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We constructed a mathematical model named the spacecraft satellite ring and employed four-point positioning in space to ascertain whether the spacecraft's path coincided with the asteroid's trajectory, thereby determining whether the avoidance action should be implemented.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Compared with traditional celestial navigation and ground-based fixed deep space navigation, we propose that positioning accuracy can be effectively enhanced through the utilization of the adjoint satellite and the validity of this theory is demonstrated by mathematical calculation.</p>
            <p>In this project, I primarily proposed the navigation model and established the mathematical model throughout.
                Upon the project's completion, I received <b>full scores(GPA 4.3/4.3)</b> from my adivisor.
